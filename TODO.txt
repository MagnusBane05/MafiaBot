Game Logic:
    Nighttime:
        !kill:
            all members of the mafia have to type !kill <player> for the same player
            there should be a way for the mafia to see who everyone is voting for and see if someone hasn't voted
        !save:
            the medic can save one player
            need to make sure they can't save the same player two nights in a row
        !check:
            the cop checks one player, then checks a different player the next nights
            once they've checked someone, they can't check them again
            once they've compared two people and the game switches to day, they should see whether or not they are on the same team
            it would also be nice to be able to see the cop's history of checks
        Once the moderator changes to day (!game day). The kills, saves and checks should be resolved and the players should be told who died.
        The cop should be dm'd what the result of their check is
        Their should be an option for the moderator to see what the nighttime actions were
    Daytime:
        !nominate:
            need two nominations to vote someone up
            would like to see who has nominated who
            people should be able to switch their nominations freely until someone has recieved two
        !vote:
            once someone is nominated, it should prompt a vote
            once everyone has voted (!vote yes/no) it will say whether or not that person was voted out
            should be able to see who still needs to vote
            their should be an option to send the moderator who voted which way
    Ending the game:
        Need to check if someone has won or not
        If so, it should send the results, and optionally, reveal everyone's roles
